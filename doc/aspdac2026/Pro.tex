\section{Proposal}

A sum-of-paths representation of a Boolean function can be derived from the Boolean Fourier decomposition~\cite{bib-odonnell}. However, this decomposition forms a complete basis for functions with 3 variables or fewer when using the CNOT+T gate set. We demonstrate that composing such decompositions enables the exact implementation of a subset of $k$-variable Boolean functions.

We use a modified Boolean Fourier decomposition approach, based on~\cite{bib-amy-phase-state}, to construct our 3-qubit-or-less library. Our synthesis is ancilla-free and schedules T gates following~\cite{amy2018} to minimize T-depth.

We then apply a modified form of the relative phase function synthesis described in~\cite{bib-amy-phase-state} to complete our circuit synthesis.
