\section{Conclusion}
\label{Conc}

We introduced a method that synthesizes a quantum circuit from an ESOP expression in such a way that it can be optimized by CNOT+T optimization methods such as T-par. We find that the T-count and T-depth produced by such an optimization method are less than those of the same optimization method on Qiskit's built-in operations, by an average of 36.5\%. However, we find corner cases where the method produces circuits that underperform after T-par relative to the default ones Qiskit produces. Further investigation into this will be a topic of future research.
