\section{Conclusion}
We introduced a method that synthesizes a quantum circuit from an ESOP expression, in such a way that
it can be optimized by CNOT+T optimization methods such as Tpar. We find that the T-count
and T-depth produced by such an optimization method is less than the action of the same optimization
method on Qiskit's built in operations, by an average of 36.5\%. However, we find corner cases where
the method underperforms the default Qiskit behavior. Further investigation into this will be a topic of
future research.
