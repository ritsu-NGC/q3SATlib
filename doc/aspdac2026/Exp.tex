\subsection{Experiment Setup}
\label{Exp:Set}
We compare the ability of T-par to optimize circuits produced using our methodology against those of
Qiskit's \texttt{PhaseOracle} method. This method takes in an ESOP expression and applies the synthesis in
Sec.~\ref{Mot:Lib}. We randomly generate ESOP expressions to feed into both of our methods, and average all
of the differences in T-count and T-depth between the two. The main code is run in python, while running
T-par as a system call to a C++ binary and EXORCISM-4 through a Python-C++ API.

Here we propose two sets of measurements:

\begin{itemize}
\item (N3) : ESOP expressions are constrained to those of $n \leq 3$. This tests the ability of the
  precomputed 3bit library to enable simplification of pure CNOT+T circuits
\item (Scramble) : ESOP expressions are again constrained to $n \leq 3$, but these are then ``scrambled''
  by using a Davio expansion of the ESOP expression according to different variable orders until an ESOP expression
  that contains cubes of $n \geq 4$ is found. This tests the ability of the proposed method to find such a
  solution in its EXORCISM-4 step, by guaranteeing that there is such an optimal solution.
\end{itemize}

We test these for $n=4-12$ literals. The ESOP expressions are randomly generated according to two groups
based on the number of cubes $k$ in them.

\begin{itemize}
\item ($k=2^(n-1)$) This increases the chances that inserted subcircuits will have common literals that allow them
  to be simplified and have reduced T-count, , while making it harder for T-par to partition any cubes $n \geq 4$
  for T-depth scheduling.
\item ($k=n$) This makes the arrangements sparser, allowing for better parallelization by T-par, but making
  it harder to have common literals that can combine to reduce T-count.
\end{itemize}
