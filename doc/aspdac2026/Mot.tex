\section{Motivation}

\subsection{
These circuits are notable because, for the 3-input case, it is straightforward to optimize the {\it T-count}, i.e., the number of T-gates and $T^{\dagger}$-gates~\cite{amy-meet-in-middle}. Optimizing T-count is crucial for fault-tolerant circuit implementation, as T-gates are expensive in most encodings~\cite{bib-herr-lattice,bib-fowler-bridge}. The {\it T-depth} is the longest sequence of T-gates in a circuit, which is also important since many modern encodings can execute T-gates in parallel for cost savings~\cite{bib-google-ecc}.

The 3-input case is interesting because it is the largest class of Boolean functions representable by a CNOT+T circuit. Since there are only 256 such Boolean functions, there are potential uses for a library of such oracles.
